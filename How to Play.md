# Characters and Game Modes

***Senpai***
The most normal character in the game. Just a regular flapping bird.

***Headstart***
Get a headstart of exactly 4 points at the start of the game. 

***TopsyTurvy***
Vertically inverted gameboard but otherwise normal.

***Dodger***
See those red lines? The space between them is the Goldilocks Zone. It marks the area where the next gap in the pipes would be.
But once you enter that zone, you cannot leave it.

***Confucius***
Get a random quote in place of the "Game Over!" text after every death.

***Freeze***
If you've tried this character already, you might have noticed that he doesn't move or fall at all. 
This is a special character. A testing-mode that I didn't really use for much testing apart from the collision code. 
Everything is frozen when he isn't moving. To fly through the zone, you have to keep on moving him upwards or downwards.

UP - fly up
DOWN - fly down
